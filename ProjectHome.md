This is a plugin to use the omegle.com service in Pidgin

To install, copy the libomegle.dll to your Pidgin/plugins directory.  You'll need [the libjson-glib dll](http://pidgin-omegle.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libjson-glib-1.0.dll) too, but you'll already have this if you have [the Facebook plugin installed](http://pidgin-facebookchat.googlecode.com)

Once you have the plugin in your plugins directory, restart Pidgin, then add a new account for Omegle.  Just fill in what you like into the username fields. 'Me' works well for me.

Right click the Omegle buddy and choose "Start random IM" to start chatting with someone random.
